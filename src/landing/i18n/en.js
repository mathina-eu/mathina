    firstSection: '<h1 class="title">Mathina promotes mathematical thinking by developing, implementing, and ' +
      'disseminating open educational tools adequate to the digital age.</h1><p>Mathina is based on story-driven ' +
      'experiences, in which children and young learners encounter fictional characters that find themselves in ' +
      'mathematical adventures. The stories bring up concepts, challenges, and puzzles that the user can interact with, ' +
      'reflect on and learn from.</p><p>Mathina can be used by parents to play with their kids, by teachers as a ' +
      'didactical tool, or directly by young learners eager to discover more maths, reinforcing the connection between ' +
      'formal and non-formal learning of mathematics.</p>',
