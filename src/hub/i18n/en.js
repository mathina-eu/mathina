    aboutContent: `<p>This is a land where incredible things happen. A land full of strange and magical creatures,
    where pirates and dragons coexist with wizards; people find riddles on the streets, and adventures surprise
    the visitor on any corner. But this land has one more peculiar characteristic: logic rules everywhere. </p>

    <p>Not only that each and every person is following rules, but so do animals and nature, too! There are birds that
    fly at a height depending on the distance to their nests, while other animals speak a coded language. Toy fairs
    only display their products if those have precise symmetric patterns, and some cities have challenging traffic signs.</p>

    <p>This land is called Platonia, where ideas and logic are treasured by everyone and found everywhere in nature.
    The inhabitants of Platonia not only accept these rules, on the contrary, they are  satisfied to have them, and
    enjoy the tricks and riddles they come across.</p>

    <p>Mathina is a young girl living in Platonia. Here, anything can turn into an adventure! Together with her brother
    Leo, they solve the challenges they come across.</p>

    <p>In Platonia there are four different regions:</p>

    <p><strong>Logi-city</strong> is a city of skyscrapers, an exciting universe for those who love to decipher stories
    and messages hidden behind corners, glass facades and street crossings.</p>

    <p>In Logi-city, the messages and stories explorers encounter are all of a logical nature. Mathina and Leo are
    challenged by transforming traffic lights, a trap hidden in the pavement, then they get involved in a thief chase,
    and also bump into a strange soccer team. Now you can choose to join Mathina and Leo in their explorations!</p>

    <p><strong>Symmetry Fair</strong> is a huge fun park with all kinds of amusements! But notice that in Symmetry
    fair everything should be ... symmetric!</p>

    <p>Mathina and Leo will find all kinds of entertainment there: strange mazes using mirrors, stalls where they can
    play many games or build symmetric toys, unusual carousels and more. They will even have the opportunity to
    contribute to improvements in the fair: either by helping to create a new carousel made up of polyhedra,
    or by stamping beautiful friezes of different types on the streets. It's just an exciting way to spend the day!</p>

    <p><strong>The Buccaneers Island</strong>? Exactly! The perfect place where to dock with our crew and where to hide
    our treasures! But wait! Everybody is looking for our hiding places, so we always use secret ways of communicating!
    Only the captain and the crew should be able to retrieve the hiding places. And what if you find a map, with maybe
    a promising "X" over it? Be prepared for a funny treasure hunt, where deciphering messages left from other pirates
    it's the way to have wonderful adventures!  If you are ready... "Welcome to Buccaneer's island"... oh, wait... "
    !dnalsi s'reenaccuB ot emocleW" this is better ;)</p>

    <p>In the <strong>land of the firebirds</strong>, flying fire creatures rule the skies. Some wizards and firebird trainers learn how
    to talk and play with dragons, phoenixes, and the minuscule sparkbugs, making incredible shapes in the air.  On this
    land Mathina and Leo will meet Flamma, an old lady that will guide them to discover the mysteries of these fire creatures.</p>
