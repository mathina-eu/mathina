    text: It was late in the afternoon and Mathina and Leo had been walking around in the forest of Arisa, looking for berries and mushrooms. They knew that the forest was safe during the day, but they had heard stories about enchanted creatures wandering during the night. They had never stayed in the forest so long in the evening, and the sun started to fade in the horizon.
   #It was not a good idea to leave the path and go into the woods. Leo just realized that the sun was behind the mountains and he started to get nervous.

    text: Suddenly, Leo heard a hissing noise surrounding them, and the colors of the light started changing, with many colorful reflections filling the shadows that started dominating the clearing of the forest. It was beautiful even if a bit mysterious… Then a type of subtle fog started moving between the trees. It was like a silk fabric appearing and disappearing, with a dim glow ranging from yellow and purple to red and green. The hissing was getting louder, and the full scene was getting hypnotic. Mathina and Leo observed in silence…
