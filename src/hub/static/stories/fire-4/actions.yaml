      It was late in the afternoon and Mathina and Leo had been walking around in the forest of Arisa, looking for berries and mushrooms. They knew that the forest was safe during the day, but they had heard stories about enchanted creatures wandering during the night. They had never stayed in the forest so long in the evening, and the sun started to fade in the horizon. It was not a good idea to leave the path and go into the woods, although they were so happy to find a big bush of berries in a hidden clearing. Leo just realized that the sun was behind the mountains and he started to get nervous.

      Mathina was picking the last berries to bring home; they could make a great cake with all these berries… Suddenly, Leo heard a hissing noise surrounding them, and the colors of the light started changing, with many colorful reflections filling the shadows that started dominating the clearing of the forest. It was beautiful even if a bit mysterious… Then a type of subtle fog started moving between the trees. It was like a silk fabric appearing and disappearing, with a dim glow ranging from yellow and purple to red and green. The hissing was getting louder, and the full scene was getting hypnotic. Mathina and Leo observed in silence…

      - text: Hey!! You two!
        char: flamma
        exposition: A voice yelled from behind them, making them jump scared.

      - text: It is too late to stay in the forest!
        char: flamma
        exposition: Mathina and Leo immediately recognized the voice of Flamma, the firebird trainer, and they were immediately reassured.

      - text: Flamma, it is you! You scared us.
        char: mathina

      - text: But what are you doing here so late?
        char: flamma
        exposition: insisted Flamma

      - text: We were just picking berries, and then there was something strange happening between the trees, some lights…
        char: leo

  - type: sceneText
    text: Flamma knew all the mythical creatures related to fire, and that was actually the reason she was there in the first place.

      - text: These are sparkbugs. They are microscopic creatures, made of living tissue and also of fire. You can get burned if you touch them, but otherwise they are not aggressive. They spread tiny droplets of burning gas around them, and they fly so close to each other that from our size and distance it appears that it is a silk tissue or string floating in the air. They appear at the sunset and during the night, releasing different gases and burning in different colors. Their light mixes with the shadows and the moonlight, and they dance and make different shapes in the air. The result is absolutely beautiful.
        char: flamma

      - text: Flamma, we want to see that, can we, please?
        char: leo

      - text: Yes, we can stay here a bit longer and later I will bring you home. Actually, I came here to study the sparkbugs. You know, as the dragons and phoenixes, all the fire creatures are very intelligent and have their own languages, and we can try to communicate with them using magical words. I still haven’t learned all their language, but I can tell you what I know.
        char: flamma

      - text: The bugs orient themselves according to a reference. It is as if they could feel two perpendicular axes in the background. Each bug is always aware of its position in the space. You cannot tell one single bug how to move or where to place itself, but instead, you can say a sentence, a condition, to the whole swarm and, each bug will place itself somewhere where it satisfies that condition.

      - text: For instance, we can say a magic sentence equivalent to what we would write as x=0, and the sparkbugs will place themselves in all the positions in the space where their x coordinate is zero.
        char: flamma


      - text: We can tell the sentence that reads y=x, but the sparkbugs do not understand it this way, we have to tell them y-x=0, which is the same. Actually, we don’t even tell them the “equal zero”, we only tell them one expression with all the variables x,y adding and multiplying, with maybe some numbers. In this case, y-x=0 means that the bugs will place themselves in all the points where their x and y coordinates are equal.
        char: flamma

      - text: If we say x·y=0, it becomes interesting, because they position themselves in all the places where the product of the x and y coordinates is zero.
        char: flamma

      - char: leo
        text: And what shape is that?

      - char: mathina
        text: Well, if x·y is zero then either x or y must be zero, so all the points with x=0 and all the points with y=0 must be on the final shape.

      - char: flamma
        text: That’s right. If we say x·y=0 we get two perpendicular lines.

      - char: leo
        text: I see. Can we make them form other shapes?

      - char: flamma
        text: Sure. If we tell them x² + y² - 1 = 0, we obtain… a circle! Can you see why?

      - char: mathina
        text: Mm, these squares… I think it has to be something related to Pythagoras…
        exposition: adventured Mathina

      - char: flamma
        text: You are close, Mathina, very close… with your intuition you could tell the bugs to make very intricate figures.

      - char: flamma
        text: The relationship between these graphics and the formulas is still today a largely unknown field. Many wizards, or as they are known outside the magical world, mathematicians, call this field of study Algebraic Geometry because it studies the relationship between Geometry and Algebra.

      - char: flamma
        text: We have been playing with curves in the plane, but if we add a third variable -the height-, a function F(x,y,z)=0 defines a surface in space. For mathematicians, it would even make sense to have more variables, even if we cannot imagine them in our three-dimensional space.

      - char: flamma
        text: Come back to the 3D app and note for instance the singular points that appear on many surfaces. No one, not even the best-trained mathematicians can tell how many singular points are possible with a polynomial of a given degree. This is an open question for degrees greater than 6.

      - char: flamma
        text: Maybe you, Mathina, or you, Leo, or you, the reader that plays with these apps, maybe you will one day discover a new surface with many singular points, or even better, a rule that explains how all these surfaces behave.

      - char: mathina
        text: I think that it would be a very nice life, to become a maths wizard. Maybe as nice as being a firebird trainer. Probably not even that much different...

      - char: leo
