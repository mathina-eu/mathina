      <p>No school this week. Mathina was already thinking about what to do during the holiday. Her mind was wandering around some nice adventures and new discoveries when a sudden noise echoed from outside the windows. In the garden, an envelope attached to a piece of wood. 
      </br >
      </br >
      Mathina ran out and opened the envelope carefully. There was a letter inside.</p>

      <p>“<i>Dear Mathina,</br>
        I hope you remember me. We met some times ago at the market on Buccaneer Island, with John the parrot. If I recall well, you liked the adventures on the island a lot. If you wish, I could have a little help on a new adventure. I fear that somebody is spying on me, so I prepared a coded message for you. The message behind this letter will tell you where and when to meet. I did not specify the key, but I am sure you will find the right one with just a few trials. Oh, I also added a little twist to avoid spies. If you want a hint, you will find a nice wooden art inside the envelope.
        </br>
        </br>
        Best,</br>
        Angela</i>“</p>

      <p>Mathina's mind immediately returned to that day at the market. She went to her room and found the jewel that Angela had given her. It was a brass pendant engraved with the letters of the alphabet shown in two concentric circles that could be rotated.</p>

      <p>Thanks to that jewel, Mathina had learned one of the methods that the pirates of Buccaneer Island used to encrypt messages. It was, after all, very simple: each letter of the message to be deciphered has to be searched for in the inner circle and replaced with the corresponding letter in the outer circle.</p>
  - type: sceneText
    text: >
      <p>Since the two circles could rotate, it was important to position them in a way agreed with who was supposed to decipher the message: for example, at the market with Angela they had agreed so that the "A" of the inner circle corresponded with the "B" of the outer circle.

      <p> Angela, Mathina and John went for the treasure hunt. Well… Once you know where it is hidden is way easier. The house was not so far from Angela’s place, and the oak was very evident. </p>
