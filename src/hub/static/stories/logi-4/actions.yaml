        char: George

      - text: What happens if we subtract one from the other? 100x + 10y + z - (x + y + z) = 99x + 9y = 9 (11x + y). This way it’s divisible by 9. And this is true for any number of digits, because the last digit is always dropped, and the rest always gets 9, 99, 999,…. 99999999 as a multiplier, because we subtract one from a power of ten.
