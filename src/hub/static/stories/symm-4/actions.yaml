      <p>Mathina then placed the structure on a table, with the initial vertex upwards, and, keeping it against the table, she noticed that the final position (all new vertices were on the plane of the table) corresponded precisely to what she wanted: now, the four angles between faces (dihedral angles) were equal.</p>

      <p>How should they continue in order to create a Platonic solid? After lifting the structure, they started by joining two triangles to the contiguous free edges, so that two of the new edges, one in each triangle, were together. Then they successively joined, in a similar way, the two missing triangles and verified that they had obtained a new polyhedron which seemed to be a Platonic solid.</p>

      <p>After having found this new Platonic solid with 4 triangles at each vertex, they moved on to look for 5 triangles, thus creating an open straight "pyramid". They decided to proceed as before: they placed the new vertices on the table in order to obtain identical dihedral angles. Then they added, to one of the free vertices, 3 triangles, so that the new solid angle would be equal to the one of the initial “opened” pyramid. Next, they joined, successively, 2 triangles in each free vertex of the “opened” pyramid, until they obtained a strip of 10 triangles. They noticed that the free edges of the strip formed a pentagon in a plane parallel to the previous one, but rotated by a tenth of a turn. They then continued the previous process: first they added 2 triangles and then, successively, they added one triangle (joined to the previous one). And their effort seemed to pay off: they obtained a new polyhedron which appeared to be a Platonic solid!</p>

      <p>Leo discovered that a new pentagon fitted securely to contiguous free edges from different pentagons. So he added three pentagons in this way. This created three new big gaps. Mathina tried to fill them with three new pentagons and they fitted precisely. At the end, they saw again three big gaps, once again with the same shape. They tried the same as before by putting three new pentagons: they fitted very well, and they even joined with each other creating a new vertex with the new added faces. As a precaution, they checked with the plasticine mould - it fitted to all vertices: they had discovered a new regular polyhedron!</p>
