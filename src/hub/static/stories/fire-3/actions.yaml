          Exciting news, Mathina! There is a firebird race in the castle of  Arisa. You did so well last time that I thought that you would like to participate. However, this time it is very different and more difficult.
        #This time it is not dragons who participate, but other firebirds that you haven’t seen yet: the phoenixes. I have talked to your grandmother and she is happy for you to come to Arisa to meet and train one phoenix. Do you want to come and try?

It would be a fantastic fortress if ever it had to be protected. At the front of the castle, the valley provided a large clearing, with ample space for all the activities that were happening. Some dragons and phoenixes were already flying in he air, with their trainers taking care of them. At some distance, some wizards wand in hand were levitating fireballs and making clouds of smoke.

    text: The three stopped a few hundred meters from the castle, where the other trainers were. Flamma greeted a man with a fantastic phoenix. The animal was like an enormous eagle, with bright red and turquoise feathers. Between the feathers, you could see a glow as if the firebird itself was burning. A long-tail ended in orange and green feathers that were sparking quietly, releasing a multi-colored smoke.

      Mathina and Leo spent the whole day training and playing with the phoenixes. They succeeded to train Liz, and all the wizards in the jury and the expert firebird trainers admired them for doing so and awarded them the Originality prize for the best trainers. They finished the day having a great dinner in a feast organized in the biggest room in the castle.
