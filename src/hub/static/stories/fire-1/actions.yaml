      <p>The woman was old but fiery and strong, like a retired ranger,
      for whom time had stopped passing by. Her hair was white and long.
      She was wearing strong leather clothes, an old worn dusty cape, boots
      like those used for riding horses, and she carried a bag, a thick rope,
      a book on her hand, and a short stick decorated with color stripes,
      too short to be used as a walking support but long enough to extend
      her arm to the floor. </p>
