    text: Mathina and her friend Leo hurried after the kangaroo on Logi-city's streets. They were quite exhausted on that hot and dry summer day as they tried to keep pace with their guide. The kangaroo promised ice cream if they joined him, but they had to see all the sights of Logi-city first! Mathina and Leo had heard of Logi-city's famous ice cream, and could hardly wait to try it.

      - text: I think we've got it all! - Leo shouted, and was again ready to cross the street. Now it was Mathina who grabbed his backpack and kept him from running across the cars.

      - text: But there are three colors and three sequences. That's good, isn't it? After all, each of the colors comes once as first, as second and as last - Leo argued convincingly.

      - text: And what if, for example, violet came first and then pink, instead of orange? - Mathina grinned like a little monkey.
        char: kangaroo
        mood: happy
      - text: Leave him, Leo is probably not as good in distinguishing pink and violet as you are - said the kangaroo.

      - text: Oh, kangaroo, don't be like that! - Mathina got angry. - I don't understand colors better just because I'm a girl! But I can think pretty well - and she stuck out her tongue at the kangaroo.
        char: kangaroo
        mood: happy
      - text: Okay... The point is that Mathina is right, these three are not enough - said the kangaroo. - But then, how many lights would be enough?
