    text: Mathina and her friend Leo hurried after the kangaroo on Logi-city's streets. They were quite exhausted on that hot and dry summer day as they tried to keep pace with their guide. The kangaroo promised ice cream if they joined him, but they had to see all the sights of Logi-city first! Mathina and Leo had heard of Logi-city's famous ice cream, and could hardly wait to try it.
