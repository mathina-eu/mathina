# Mathematical concepts
​
The story entitled The traffic light challenge aims to offer a small but challenging set of combinatorics-based problems. Children may discover and solve these problems together with their teachers or parents. Combinatorics has a fundamental role in developing logical thinking. Developing the ability to organize a variety of elements in different ways helps children build up the concept of sorting and grouping, developing algorithmic thinking and systematic approaches. 

Combinatorial problems are connected to different mathematical areas and can be explored at diﬀerent levels. Therefore, combinatorics is available as an overarching theme, which can be introduced already in kindergarten and built upon throughout the entire school education for developing problem-solving abilities of diﬀerent age groups.  

In combinatorial games, the player selects from a set according to a certain condition and wants to see all possible combinations. If there are a few combinations only, students may come across all of them even by chance. If there are many combinations, students are encouraged to come up with a systematic approach, such as sorting numbers, which reveals which cases are still missing or which are repeated. Sorting cases can be defined according to one or more criteria, therefore sorting can follow a two- or three-dimensional layout.

In The traffic light challenge, traffic lights are coloured violet, orange, and pink in different variations. There are various ways to start discovering this problem. After some experimentation,  children will recognize strategic, systematic approaches, e.g. to group first those lights which are violet on the top, then those with orange on the top, finally those with pink on the top. This way it can be seen that the number of all possible colorings is 6.

In this story, the following basic mathematical concepts are playing an important role in addition to combinatorics:

+ Add: To combine, put together two or more quantities.
+ Addend: Any number being added. 
+ Pattern: A repeating or growing sequence or design. An ordered set of objects, numbers, or shapes arranged according to a rule. 
+ Sequence: A set of objects/numbers arranged in special order or pattern.
+ Sum: The answer to an addition problem.

# Didactical remarks
Our goal is to develop thinking. It is important to practice generalization, specialization, analogical extension, systematization, abstraction, and case separation.

The development of thinking is comparable to circular construction. We go back and forth to a way of thinking, and when we deal with that, we need other elements of thinking as well in order to reach our goal. When we contemplate another task, then previous experiences also come into play - it’s like polyphonic music. We return to ways of thinking again and again, but on higher levels. When we put down a small thought like a building block, we’ll later build another one on top of it. 

I play with a thought, a thought plays with me. This attitude is possible to develop by practice. Once we’ve found the answer to a question, we think about how we got there. We contemplate, analyze what led us to success, and which paths we took. One of the ways of thinking is experimentation. We ask questions, redefine the task, then choose new aspects. However, it’s good if these questions are asked by the children themselves, and not by the teacher.

Reading and playing with The traffic light challenge doesn’t require any additional materials, nor preliminary knowledge. 

The approach to the subject is, however, different from what is usually used in formal education. Here you encounter: 
+ storytelling,
+ attractive visual framework,
+ games and challenges in apps.

# Suggestions for additional exercises
For the age group 4-6, sorting games combined with body movement can be suggested (games with colored balls / 3-4 different types of objects / music instruments). Let’s encourage children to classify, compare and arrange objects and discover patterns and changes. In combinatorial games, patterns in nature and the indoor environment can be well observed and implemented.

**Solitaire game**
Create 3 red, 3 blue, and 3 green cards, and then put the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in each color. The task is to place the cards in a 3 × 3 table so that all three colors and all three numbers are represented in each row and each column. A more advanced version of the game is created with a 4x4 table.

**Sudoku** refines thinking skills. Here is an example: 1. Enter the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 in the blank fields so that all four numbers are present in each row, each column, and each framed square.

# About the apps
There are 3 apps accompanying the story. The first app enables free play with color sequences, the second one aims at differentiating between identical and diverse sequences. The third game lets the user find the last missing piece in the sequence.

All apps were programmed in JavaScript and are optimized both for PCs and tablets/smartphones. Below see the short description of each app. Links are provided both for apps and user guide videos.

[First game in the story]($HUB_URL/story/the-traffic-light-challenge/?actionLink=firstGame)

The user sees a conventional traffic light with three possible lights. In this game, the user sets the colors and is also able to add additional traffic lamps (up to 8 pieces total) to be colored. Colors can be reset if necessary.
