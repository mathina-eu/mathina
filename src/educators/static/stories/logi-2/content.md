# Mathematical concepts
​
It is rather a conventional challenge if we have to move from one state or position to another one. In these situations we consider how to begin and how to finish in the best possible way. We do the same whenever we look for the right way in a maze. 

There is a saying which goes like this: “The wise always begin at the end.” 

By taking a look at the exercise contained in The tiled floor trap, we can see that working in the opposite direction leads to a result. One of the most effective thinking processes we employ to solve problems is changing our perspective. We use our ability to define relationships, organize and rearrange data and to thereby discover new connections. A change of perspective is a thought operation independent of the mathematical content. The most common way of using it in the different chapters of mathematics, is the so-called “cancer method” or reverse thinking. During the procedure we start out from the end and move towards the beginning. 

The tools of problem-solving are the following:
+ Understanding the problem / situation
+ Analysis, orientation, exploration
+ Planning
+ Execution
+ Inspection

Working on problems that require thinking out-of-the-box can help children develop metacognitive skills and a flexible understanding of mathematical concepts. It can also foster their confidence and eagerness to approach unknown situations and explore multiple solution strategies.

In **The tiled floor trap**, the following basic mathematical concepts play an important role:

+ Pattern: A repeating or growing sequence or design. An ordered set of objects, numbers, or shapes arranged according to a rule
+ Polygon: A closed figure formed from line segments that meet only at their endpoints
+ Sequence: A set of objects/numbers arranged in a certain order or pattern

# Didactical remarks

It is important that the teacher or parent accompanying the child maintains their role. This role includes posing problems and questions, encouraging reasoning, reflection, discussing strategies, sharing ideas, and collaborating toward solutions.

Reading and playing with **The tiled floor trap** doesn’t require any additional materials, nor preliminary knowledge. 

The approach to the subject is, however, different from what is usually used in formal education. Here you encounter: 
+ storytelling,
+ an attractive visual framework,
+ games and challenges in apps.


## Suggestions for additional exercises
The widely used mathematics educational toolkit called **Dienes logic blocks** can be employed for similar games. The tiles in the 48-piece set are characterized by four properties: color (red, green, blue, or yellow), shape (circle, square, triangle), size (small or large), and with or without perforation.

We can play a two-player game with the tiles. Both players receive 10-10 tiles. The rule is that neighbouring tiles should only differ from each other in one single attribute. Players lay down a piece one after the other on the table. The player who cannot continue the game, loses.

Another exercise with the same set is to complete the series below:

# About the apps

The story is accompanied by one app, which appears in the story twice. At the first occasion users have the chance to play with the app freely. At the second time the suggestion is to try and find the solution by thinking backwards.

The app was programmed in JavaScript and is optimized both for PCs and tablets/smartphones. Below see the short description of the app. Links are provided both for the app and the user guide video. 

The rule for this game is that users can only step from red field to red field, from blue to blue, green to green, yellow to yellow; or from circle to circle, square to square, triangle to triangle.
