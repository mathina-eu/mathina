# Mathematical concepts

The story **My gold, please!** is based on the divisibility rule for 9. If students don’t rush, they may notice that after the first subtraction, the number of gold medals can be divided by 9. 

Math becomes exciting each time we encounter an unusual question. Finding a solution is adventurous, and often takes a long time and several tries followed by disappointment. It’s happiness when you manage to unfold the answer. Students learn to think logically through pondering, which is useful for a lifetime.

Theoretical literature generally defines a problem as an achievable goal with an unknown road leading up to it. Solving the problem generally means finding this unknown path. Ordinary life raises less well-defined problems, perhaps even ones in which the achievable goal is not even clear. In practical situations, the conditions are often not precisely enough defined, we may have to rely on coincidence or prior knowledge in order to solve the problem.

On the other hand, we don’t begin solving a problem if we are not motivated - we are not interested in the task or it seems to be too simple, or it requires more knowledge, knowledge.

Thinking is a complex process, during which various cognitive skills and abilities are activated in order to find a solution. 

Therefore, it is important to have general thinking skills such as: 

+ Analysis - synthesis
+ Inductive - deductive thinking
+ Abstraction - concretization
+ Generalization - specialization
+ Comparison
+ Sort by systematization
+ Classification
+ Addition
+ Analogous thinking
+ Exploring connections
+ Highlight
+ Judgment making, decision
+ Transfer

In this story, the following basic mathematical concepts play an important role:

+ Add: To combine, put together two or more quantities.
+ Addend: Any number being added. 
+ Arithmetic sequence: A sequence such which has a constant difference between terms.
+ Input: A value of the independent variable. 
+ Numerical (quantitative) data: Numerical/quantitative data are numbers in context. 
+ Pattern: A repeating or growing sequence or design. An ordered set of objects, numbers, or shapes arranged according to a rule. 
+ Sequence: A set of objects/numbers arranged in special order or pattern.
+ Solution: Any and all value(s) of the variable(s) which; satisfies an equation, or inequality.
+ Sum: The answer to an addition problem.
+ Table of values: A list of numbers that are used to substitute one variable, such as within an equation of a line or other functions, to find the value of the other variable.
+ Term: A mathematical expression which may form a separable part of an equation, a series, or another expression.

# Didactical remarks
It is important that the teacher or parent accompanying the child maintains his/her role. This role includes posing problems and questions, encouraging reasoning, reflection, discussing strategies, sharing ideas, and collaborating toward solutions.

Reading and playing with **My gold, please!** doesn’t require any additional materials, nor preliminary knowledge. 

The approach to the subject is, however, different from what is usually used in formal education. Here you encounter: 
+ storytelling,
+ an attractive visual framework,
+ games and challenges in apps.

## Suggestions for additional exercises: ##
A game for two: Think of a four-digit number, calculate the sum of its digits, and subtract that from the number you are thinking of. Delete the first digit of the number received and show the remaining number to your mate. I will tell you which digit you erased.

How do I know?

An example. Let the number be 5271. The sum of the digits is: x.
The difference is y. Once the first digit is deleted, 256 remains.
The magician sees the number 256 and is able to tell the deleted digit, 5. How??
Good brainstorming, lots of fun to think about!

# About the apps #
The story is accompanied by one app, which is used three times in the frameworks of the story. Users have the chance to play with the app freely. 

The app was programmed in JavaScript and is optimized both for PCs and tablets/smartphones. Below see the short description of the app. Links are provided both for the app and the user guide video.

The first person receives as many gold medals, which equal the sum of the digits of the total number of gold medals received by the team. For example, if the team won 721 gold medals, then the first team member gets 7 + 2 + 1, i.e. 10 gold medals. There remains 721 minus 10, or 711 gold medals. The next one gets the sum of the digits of the gold left this way. And so on.  
The educator has the possibility to create variations of the exercise by using the last app in the story [Last Game in Story]($HUB_URL/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=firstGame)
