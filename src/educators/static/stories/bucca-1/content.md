# ENG - BUCCA-1: The secret messages

Mathematical concept 


From the point of view of the mathematical content, the purpose of this story is to introduce cryptography and its fundamental aspects in a playful and informal way. In the story, Leo and his friends find themselves wanting to communicate information to friends who are not with them, but they want to prevent that information from getting to other people. Leo remembers a way to "communicate in secret without secrecy" that his older sister, Mathina, had taught him.

A simple cryptographic method is thus presented. Nevertheless, this has all the characteristics of a modern and effective cryptographic method. There is a procedure, the actual method, which allows you to hide the message to be transmitted and there is the key (that is, a code, a number or a concept) that allows anyone who knows it to understand the hidden message. The cryptographic method used by Leo and his friends involves choosing a key and for this purpose they choose a phrase that allows us to identify a precise figure: for example, "has six sides" will allow us to identify a hexagon among the following figures :

Images in the story

The method to encrypt the message is simply to write other false messages similar to the real message you want to hide and to draw a different picture on each message. At this point all the messages, contradictory as a whole, can be placed in plain sight so that anyone can read them. Only those who have the key ("has six sides") will immediately understand what the correct message is by seeing the hexagon drawn on it. In the three interactive experiences the readers know the key and are involved, for the first two interactive experiences in the encoding process (LINK to IO3 repository) and in the third app, in the decoding process of the message (LINK to IO3 repository).


## Didactical Comments

Cryptography, in its most ancient form, was born in the times of ancient Greece precisely with the aim of communicating information in secrecy without the enemies being able to understand them. If the purpose of the app in the text is to play with a simple cryptographic method, another fundamental aspect of cryptography is also presented in the story: it is always possible that someone intercepts our message, understands the method used to hide it and tries all possible keys in order to decrypt the message. The strength of a cryptographic method lies in the fact that a person who does not have the key, will have to take a long time to try all the possible keys and this should discourage him from trying. The story can be understood without the need to explain cryptographic concepts before reading it and offers a variety of insights into how simple ciphers suitable for children with varying degrees of proficiency can be made. For example, for children who already know the letters, the story’s method can be modified with the help of an adult who prepares the messages and with keys that refer to the letters.


## App

There are three interactive experiences throughout the story. They are linked to key moments in the encryption and decryption process of the message and the choice of the key.

All the apps were programmed in JavaScript and should be usable both on PCs and tablets/smartphones.

Below, we present a small description of each app. Links both for the apps and for explanatory films about them (in Mathina’s YouTube channel) are also provided.


### App #1 - Keys and messages I (**link to the IO3 Repository**)

In the first experience, the key is “it has six sides” and the message you want to convey is “TRUE MESSAGE TO INSERTED HERE”. The user must drag the message to be transmitted and the figure that is described by the key (an hexagon) to the center of the screen. In this experience the images available are abstract figures.

### App #2 - Keys and messages II (**link to the IO3 Repository**)

The second app proposes the same situation as the first, the one linked to the encoding of the message, but with a different key ("the sky is full of them"). Moreover, unlike with the first app, there are more images than messages and there are two possible images that meet the demands: a star and a cloud. The user must associate one of these two images with the correct message and combine the false messages with images different from these two.

### App #3 - Keys and messages III (**link to the IO3 Repository**)

In the third and last experience, the readers are instead involved in the process of decoding the message: they know the key (which is again “the sky is full of it”) and they must select the secret message among those proposed.
