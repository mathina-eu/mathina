# Mathematical concepts
The story introduces the idea of coordinates, and the representation of a vector (an arrow, a graphical element) by a pair of numbers (a purely symbolic and abstract element).

We saw in “The firebird trainer” vectors representing the movement (velocity and direction) of a point following a smooth curve. Now, we use vectors to define a polygonal line, by giving a list of pairs of numbers. Each pair defines a vector, and each vector has its base at the tip of the previous one. This way, the vectors can be added, providing an algebraic structure and a way of manipulating them. This is a key feature of vectors, which shows that his numerical representation provides new ways to get insights and deduce consequences.

The result of following a vector (a,b) and next a vector (c,d) will leave us in the position (a+c, b+d). Similarly, we can add any list of vectors. 

# Didactical remarks

The user has already made the connection between the intuitive idea of movement and those of the arrow (movement vector), which makes a sort of encoding. Now the user faces a new encoding, that of representing an arrow by a pair of numbers, its coordinates. This jump adds to the graphical and visual domain the new symbolic representation.

When children start to reading they also recognize written numbers that represent quantities. On this early exposure to vector quantities, children will realize that there are quantities that can be measured, but that they need more than one number to be represented.

Together with reading, children will learn basic addition. This story takes advantage of that learning to show that one can add those multi-number quantities (pairs). The story and its apps also provide an intuitive introduction to negative numbers. Even users not familiar with this concept yet will be capable of grasping the connection through stepping forwards and backwards (similarly upwards and downwards).


# About the Apps
The layout of all three apps is similar. The lower edge represents the ground. It might have one or more mountains, which are to be avoided during the flight. The light blue background represents the sky (there might be clouds, which are also obstacles). There is a grid pattern made of white dots, representing the coordinates. When the app is started, the unidragon will sit on the lower left. It will return there, once the 'Back' button is clicked. You can create a flight path for the dragon by entering vectors through the control panel on the lower edge. Once you click the 'Go' button, the dragon will follw the created path.

## App 1 - Fly the Unidragon with pairs of numbers

In this app, the user can get used to using the control panel and creating a path for the dragon. There is no other explicit goal to reach. The unidragon will fly one vector at a time, so the user should follow this sequence: think about where the dragon should fly to, enter a vector, click 'Go', think about where to move next, and so on.

## App 2 - Fly to the Castle

In this app, the goal is to reach the castle on the lower right side of the screen. The button 'Add' was added to the control panel.
