# Mathematical concepts
The story introduces the idea of coordinates, and the representation of a vector (an arrow, a graphical element) by a pair of numbers (a purely symbolic and abstract element).

We saw in “The firebird trainer” vectors representing the speed (velocity and direction) of a point following a smooth curve. Here we use vectors to define a polygonal line, by giving a list of pairs of numbers. Each pair defines a vector, and each vector has its base at the tip of the previous one. This way, the vectors can be added, providing an algebraic structure and a way of manipulating them. This is a key feature of vectors, which shows that his numerical representation provides new ways to get insights and deduce consequences.

The result of following a vector (a,b) and next a vector (c,d) will leave us in the position (a+c, b+d). Similarly, we can add any list of vectors. 

# Didactical remarks

The child has already made the connection between the intuitive idea of speed and those of the arrow (speed vector), which makes a sort of encoding. Now the child faces a new encoding, that of representing an arrow by a pair of numbers, its coordinates. This jump leaves the graphical and visual domain to enter the symbolic representation.

When about 7 years old, children start reading independently and recognizing written numbers that represent quantities. On this early exposure to vector quantities, children will realize that there are quantities that can be measured, but that they need more than one number to be represented.

Shortly after reading, children will learn basic addition in school. This story takes advantage of that learning to show that one can add those multi-number quantities (pairs).
