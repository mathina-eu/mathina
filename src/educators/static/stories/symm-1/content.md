# Mathematical concepts

The main goal of this story is to explore, in an amusing way, notions related to **reflection symmetry**.

In a first phase, the idea is to acquaint children with the concept of
[“symmetry axis”](https://mathina-hub.netlify.app/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=tg1)
: the process used in the story to check if an image has symmetry axis is folding the image in half (horizontally or vertically) and see if the two parts overlap. And there are three types of images explored throughout the story: some images with a vertical symmetry axis, some with an horizontal one, and some without any symmetry axes.

Later on, children can learn how to construct, by themselves, images with symmetry axes: not only images made up of 
[polygons and circles](https://mathina-hub.netlify.app/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=tg2)
, but also images formed by 
[segments](https://mathina-hub.netlify.app/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=tg3)

In the app “Building Toys (I)”, notions related to the recognition of some geometric figures -- triangles, squares and circles -- are also 
[explored](https://mathina-hub.netlify.app/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=tg4)
, namely the distinction between congruent triangles, but with different orientations:

# Didactical remarks

By using storytelling and games, our main goal is to lead children to discover Symmetry in a playful way.

Starting with some concrete experiments carried out by the characters, experiments which are thoroughly illustrated by the animations and images provided, we present in an intuitive way the concept of symmetry axis. The understanding of this concept is deepened throughout the story, and children have the opportunity to consolidate their knowledge, in a playful way, by solving the various challenges proposed in the available apps.

The story is self-contained and should not require consulting additional materials. For this purpose, two factors were taken into account: 1) no need of previous knowledge of the subject; 2) adequacy of the contents to the 4/6 age group. Our approach to this subject differs, however, from what is usually used in formal education: by using storytelling, by providing visually attractive interactive examples, and by offering a large number of games and challenges in the form of apps.

All the experiments provided in the story can be physically developed by educators:

`*` by printing images in a semi-transparent paper, children can fold them and search for symmetry axes;

`*` the “Finding the Good Toys” game can be physically played, by providing the children with several drawings: some with symmetry axes and others without them. And such drawings could, for instance, be previously made by other children in a different activity;

`*` by creating coloured geometric images of triangles, squares, and circles, and also a square board (for instance a cardboard one), the game “Building Toys I” can be played by children. Likewise, the game “Building Toys II” can easily be simulated with students, using a physical GeoBoard.

# About the apps

There are 4 apps accompanying the story: 1 dedicated to check if an image has (horizontal or vertical) symmetry axis; 1 to select all the images with symmetry axes; and the remaining 2 to create symmetric images.

All the apps were programmed in JavaScript and should be usable both on PCs and tablets/smartphones.
Below, we present a small description of each app. Links both for the apps and for explanatory films about them (in Mathina’s YouTube channel) are also provided. 

&nbsp;

## [Game 1 - Folding Images (I, II and III)](https://mathina-hub.netlify.app/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=tg5)

An image is provided. The user is invited to check if the given image has a symmetry axis. For that, he/she should fold the image in half (horizontally and vertically) and see if the two parts overlap.

## [Game 2 - Finding the Good Toys](https://mathina-hub.netlify.app/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=tg6)

A set of 16 drawings of animals is shown. The user is invited to choose all the images which are symmetric and place them in a box.

## [Game 3 - Building Toys (I)](https://mathina-hub.netlify.app/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=tg7)

The following items are displayed on the screen: a vertical red line, a gray squared background and a non-symmetric image built with coloured shapes.The user is invited to drag some coloured shapes at his/her disposal and put them in the gray squares in order to create a symmetric image with respect to the red line.

## [Game 4 - Building Toys (II)](https://mathina-hub.netlify.app/story/mathina-wins-a-lot-of-new-toys/?actionLink=tg8)

The following items are displayed on the screen: a red line, a geoboard and an image, made up of black segments, drawn in one of the sides of the red line. The user is invited to draw the missing segments in order to create a symmetric image with respect to the red line.
