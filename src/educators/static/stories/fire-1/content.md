# Mathematical concepts
The concepts we are exploring here are that of direction, speed and trajectory. A curve is presented as the trace that a moving point leaves on the plane. This corresponds to the familiar idea of a pencil drawing on the paper. However, the moving point is not controlled directly, but from a distance, encoded by an arrow representing its movement. More precisely, the direction of the arrow indicates the direction, and its length represents the speed. Together, direction and speed are the velocity vector of the moving point.

The velocity vector is always tangent to the curve. We can make the speed zero and the moving point stops. If we want the curve to have a sharp angle (for instance a 90 degree turn), we need to make the speed null at the turning point.

# Didactical remarks
Children at this age are learning to coordinate movements and making sense of spatial notions such as directions or right and left. Although right-handedness or left-handedness can be discovered as early as 3-4 years old, many children do not distinguish reliably between left and right during these early years. This story will thus firstly help with spatial orientation development.

The games develop the notion of action at a distance, or encoding of information. While the most natural way for children to express the shape of a curve is to draw it on a paper or with a finger into the air, here they presented with an encoded input, a generating procedure, for which they have to develop a new intuition, as probably it is the first time they encounter it.

Children will make the conceptual jump of linking the basic idea of velocity (which they have already had the time to learn intuitively for instance from cars, from moving themselves, from any moving object), with the representation of it as an arrow (the magic wand). The arrow is an abstract representation of that invisible property of the objects. Furthermore, controlling the velocity we can go, given enough time, to any position we want to reach.

The exercises for following a curve will pose a particular challenge on the coordination of hand and sight.

# About the Apps

All three apps in this story use the same control element - the magic wand held by a hand, which is fixed to the position in the middle of the lower edge of the screen. The unidragon will always fly in the direction the wand is pointing to. So the horn of the dragon and the magic wand (which is actually the milk horn of this unidragon, as explained in the story) will always be parallel. The direction of the flight of the unidragon can be changed by turning the wand.

The speed of the unidragon's flight can be controlled by touching the wand at different distances from the hand holding the wand. The speed is zero if the user touches it (with the mouse pointer or her/his own finger for touch devices) close to where the hand is holding the wand. The speed increases as the wand is touched further away from the hand (the hand is also the turning point for the wand). In the images below (from left to right) you see the aura of the wand increasing, which represents the speed. The larger the aura the higher the speed of the unidragon. If the user lets go (i.e. stopps clicking the mouse or does not touch the screen anymore) the dragon will also stop midair. This particular behavior was implemented to make it easier to control the flight and to reduce the stress level of the user.

The dragon may fly off the screen but will return if the user guides him back using the wand. The user can also use the 'Back' button to teleport the dragon to his original position in the middle of the screen.

## [App 1 - Fly the Unidragon]($HUB_URL/story/the-firebird-trainer/?actionLink=app1)

In this app, the user can get used to controlling the flight of the unidragon with the magic wand. There is no explicit goal to reach. Since the unidragon leaves a smoky trace along his flight path, the user may try to create some intentional patterns (i.e. first letter of a name, a special number, a symbol  like a heart or anything else the user can connect to). Start from large and bold patterns and go on to smaller and more intricate ones. Play around with controlling the wand, try sharp turns, spirals, zigzags...

## [App 2 - Catch the Fireballs]($HUB_URL/story/the-firebird-trainer/?actionLink=app2)

In this second app, the user is asked to catch the appearing fireballs (unidragons' favourite snack). Once a fireball is catched, the next will appear at a different position. The number of successfully catched fireballs is displayed in the upper left corner. Unidragons don't like the clouds. They need to be avoided. If the unidragon flies into one of the clouds, he gets pushed back to the last place a fireball was picked up.

## [App 3 - Follow the Curve]($HUB_URL/story/the-firebird-trainer/?actionLink=app3)

When the app is started, the user is presented a yellow curve in the air, which the unidragon needs to follow. There is no specific starting point, just fly to the nearest point on the curve (or any other point on the curve) and try to follow the curve. It does not matter if the dragon flies clockwise or counterclockwise. Try to stay as close to the given curve as possible and move along the whole curve. You have successfully followed the curve when it disappears. A new curve will be displayed which you can now follow in order to increase your score, again displayed in the upper left corner.
