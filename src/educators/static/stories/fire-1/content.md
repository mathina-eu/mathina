# Mathematical concepts
The concepts we are exploring here are that of direction, speed and trajectory. A curve is presented as the trace that a moving point leaves on the plane. This corresponds to the familiar idea of a pencil drawing on the paper. But the moving point is not controlled directly, but from a distance, encoded by an arrow representing its speed. More precisely, the direction of the arrow indicates the direction, and its length represents the value of the velocity. Together, direction and velocity are the speed vector of the moving point.

The speed vector is always tangent to the curve. We can make the speed zero and the moving point stops. If we want the curve to have a sharp angle (for instance a 90 degree turn), we need to make the speed null at the turning point.

# Didactical remarks
Children at this age are learning to coordinate movements and making sense of spatial notions such as directions or right and left. Although right-handedness or left-handedness can be discovered as early as 3-4 years old, many children have trouble distinguishing between left and right during years. This story will thus firstly help with spatial orientation development.

The game develops the notion of action at a distance, or encoding of information. While the most natural way for a child to express the shape of a curve is to draw it on a paper, here the child is presented with an encoded input, a generating procedure, for which he or she has to develop a new intuition, as probably it is the first time he or she encounters it.

The child will make the conceptual jump of linking the speed idea (which he or she has already had the time to learn intuitively from cars, from moving himself, from any moving object), with the representation of it as an arrow. The arrow is an abstract representation of that invisible property of the objects. Furthermore, controlling the speed we can go, given enough time, to any position we want to reach.

The exercises for following a curve will pose a particular challenge on the coordination of hand and sight.
