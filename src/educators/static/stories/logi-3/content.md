# Mathematical concepts

The story Cats and Dogs deals with the “art gallery problem”, a so-called visibility problem. Visibility in geometry is a mathematical abstraction of the real-life notion of visibility. 

Given a set of obstacles in the Euclidean space, two points in the space are said to be visible to each other, if the line segment that joins them does not intersect any obstacles. 

A famous solution to the problem gives an upper bound on the minimal number of guards. It states that n/3 guards are always sufficient and sometimes necessary to guard a simple polygon with n vertices.

Computation of visibility is among the basic problems in computational geometry and has applications in computer graphics, motion planning, and other areas.

Many of our everyday activities are based on algorithmic patterns. We travel to another city and we have to catch the bus, we schedule meetings or look for a lost object in our home, we have to group the plates in the cupboard according to size, shape and color or have to rank in size order in the gym, we look for the best chess player…

Algorithmic patterns are, often unnoticed, an integral part of our lives. We often rationalize our day-to-day activities using an algorithmic pattern in order to increase our efficiency and thereby save time and energy. For example, when planning our trip from point A to point B, we take into account the travel time, the number of transfers, the walking distance, and finally create the right itinerary.

Algorithmic patterns lead to disciplined thinking. Going through the steps, the user evaluates the situation, rejects or reinforces his or her own idea. Each successful step and especially a successful solution strengthens self-esteem.

If children don’t get along with solving a problem, they often try guessing. It is good if they understand that they are able to cope with everyday situations better - especially with practical (mathematical) tasks - if they set up an algorithmic pattern for it.

# Didactical remarks

It is important that the teacher or parent accompanying the child maintains his/her role. This role includes posing problems and questions, encouraging reasoning, reflection, discussing strategies, sharing ideas, and collaborating toward solutions.

Reading and playing with Cats and dogs doesn’t require any additional materials, nor preliminary knowledge. 

The approach to the subject is, however, different from what is usually used in formal education. 
Here you encounter: 
+ storytelling, 
+ an attractive visual framework, 
+ games and challenges in apps.

## Suggestions for additional exercises: 
Select as many of the 36 dots as possible, without choosing two dots on the same straight line.

Place as many queens on the chessboard as possible without hitting one another.

# About the apps 

The story is accompanied by one app in three slightly different versions. At the first occasion users have the chance to play with the app freely. At the second and third time a solution is needed among different conditions.

The app was programmed in JavaScript and is optimized both for PCs and tablets/smartphones. Below see the short description of the app. Links are provided both for the app and the user guide video.

The user sees a map and two police hats. The goal is to find out whether two policemen are able to oversee all roads of the city or more are needed. The user is able to move the icons on the map and the roads overseen will appear highlighted. Free play; no solutions are required this time.
