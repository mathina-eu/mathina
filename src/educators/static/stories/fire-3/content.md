# Mathematical concepts
Functions are transformations that take an input number x and give out an output value y=f(x). We can make a graph of the function, by plotting the points (x, f(x)) in cartesian coordinates, yielding a curve in the plane. Some important examples of such curves are straight lines (first degree), parabolas (second degree) or polynomial curves.

Those polynomials can be defined by their coefficients. An interesting technique is to find the (only) polynomial of degree n that passes through (n+1) selected points. This is called the Lagrange polynomial interpolation, and it is an algebraic manipulation exercise.

The polynomial curves can also be traced with their speed vector. This vector is calculated from the derivative of the function that defines the curve. The derivative of a function describes the rate of change of the function, and thus, whether the function is increasing or decreasing when advancing in the variable.

If we prescribe the derivative of the function (indicating the moments when the function should increase or decrease and how much), and we fix the value of the function at one starting point, we can reconstruct the original function.



# Didactical remarks
Children at this age are able to use symbolic expressions (functions and equations). This story exploits that to describe curves, and get exposed to the ideas of growth rate and derivative. Stories and apps are more open-ended, giving more options to explore.

# About the Apps

## App 1 

Upon opening the app, you will see a coordinate system, a yellow graph and a purple one. The yellow one is the desired flight path of the phoenix, the goal to achieve. The purple curve is a polynomial function of the variable x. It can be adjusted with the control panel. For each power of x, you can change the corresponding parameter of the polynomial.

The degree of the polynomial - the values of the exponents of x - will increase as you progress (the maximum is `@x^3@`). Each parameter can be changed with the + and - buttons, where each click will change it by +/- 0.1. You can also hold down to create a constat increase of the value. Once the correct flight path is entered, the phoenix will automatically fly along it. Afterwards, a new flight path challenge is offered for the user. You may use the previous function, which will still be displayed, or use the 'Delete' button, to set all parameters to zero, and start fresh.
