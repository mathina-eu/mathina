# Mathematical concepts

The main goal of this story is to present, in an amusing way, several concepts related to the polyhedra and their symmetry.

We focus on two specific classes of polyhedra which have a large number of symmetries (more informally, which are very symmetrical): **Platonic Solids** and **Uniform Polyhedra**.

In the story, before introducing these polyhedra, we dwell on an important geometrical concept: **convexity**. Several of the results presented strongly depend on the fact that both Platonic Solids and Uniform Polyhedra are convex.

## Convex polyhedron

In the story, an example of a non convex polyhedron is found by chance, when Leo tries to close a vehicle of a Polyhedron Carousel and [some of the vehicle components turn inward]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg1).

| ------ | ----------- |
| Icosahedron | Non convex polyhedron, created by placing a vertex of the icosahedron into its interior and considering the polyhedron thus obtained ([Click here to manipulate the polyhedron]($HUB_URL/apps/anims/poliedros.html?pre=pol_1)) |

This way, instead of getting an icosahedron, a non convex polyhedron is obtained. 

The definition used in the story is the following: **a polyhedron is convex** if, for each couple of points on the faces, the whole segment joining the points is contained in the polyhedron.

## Platonic Solids

The main idea we intend to convey on the subject is that a **Platonic Solid** is a polyhedron "as regular as possible". Thus, a platonic solid should satisfy the following properties:

`*` their faces are all regular polygons and equal to each other (same number of edges, all with the same length);

`*` at each vertex the same number of faces meet;

`*` the [**dihedral angles**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg2), i.e. the angles between contiguous faces, are equal;

`*` the [**solid angles**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg3) at each vertex are equal.

### Building all Platonic Solids

In the story, Mathina and Leo remember a polyhedron which satisfies all these properties: the **cube**.

When trying to build a cube, Leo discovers, experimentally, a 
[**cube net**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg4)
, and, later on, he realizes that the net is not unique (there are several other options). Throughout the story, the relations between a polyhedron and its nets are also explored in the remaining Platonic Solids.

The two characters then decide to embrace the challenge of **finding, in a constructive way, all the remaining Platonic solids**. They observe that, in a cube, the number of squares arriving at each vertex -- **3** -- is always the same (as mentioned in one of the properties referred above). What if the number of squares was different from 3?
[They easily conclude that this is not possible.]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg5)

So, they decide to move on to triangles, which must be equilateral (according to the properties mentioned above).

Following the same approach as before, the characters consider the case of 3 triangles joining in each vertex. By doing so, they discover a second Platonic Solid: the [**tetrahedron**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg6).

Passing to 4 triangles in each vertex, the characters build another Platonic Solid: the [**octahedron**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg7). Finally, by choosing 5 triangles in each vertex, they find the [**icosahedron**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg8).

After concluding that it is not possible to build Platonic solids with more than 5 triangles in each vertex, the characters move on to [**regular pentagons**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg9). Again, by joining 3 polygons in each vertex, Leo and Mathina find a new Platonic Solid: the [**dodecahedron**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg10).

Leo and Mathina soon conclude that not only it is impossible to build Platonic solids with more than 3 pentagons at each vertex, but it is also impossible to build Platonic solids by [**using polygons with more than 5 sides**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg11). Thus, they have discovered all the [**Platonic Solids**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg12).

| Cube | Tetrahedron | Octahedron | Icosahedron | Dodecahedron |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|![Cube](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/cubo.png =138x150)|![Tetrahedron](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/tetra.png =126x150)|![Octahedron](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/octa.png =162x150)|![Icosahedron](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/icosa.png =155x150)|![Dodecahedron](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/dodeca.png =146x150)|

### Platonic Solids - definition

A more simple **definition of Platonic Solid** is given by the technician: a Platonic Solid is a convex polyhedron whose faces are all regular polygons equal to each other, and at each vertex arrive the same number of faces.

In fact, it is possible to prove that a polyhedron satisfying these conditions has the following properties:

`*` the dihedral angles are equal;

`*` the solid angles at each vertex are equal.

**Remark 1**: Notice that, following this new definition, in order to check if a polyhedron is Platonic, there is no need to compare its dihedral angles or its solid angles at each vertex (in the story, the characters studied these angles because they were not aware of the previous result).

**Remark 2**: If we remove the condition “at each vertex arrive the same number of faces”, we can also get non Platonic Solids, as shown in [Game 4]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg13).

## Uniform Polyhedra

What is a uniform polyhedron? Examining a uniform polyhedron, the cuboctahedron, Mathina guesses it is a polyhedron whose faces are all regular polygons, but not all with the same number of sides, and for which [the solid angles at each vertex are equal]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg14).

| Cuboctahedron (uniform polyhedron) | Great rhombicuboctahedron (uniform polyhedron) | Miller polyhedron (non uniform polyhedron) | Small rhombicuboctahedron(uniform polyhedron) |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|![Cuboctahedon](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/cubocta.png =137x150)|![4-6-8](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/4-6-8.png =149x150)|![Miller Polyhedron](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/Miller.png =151x150)|![3-4-4-4](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/3-4-4-4.png =150x150)|

However, following “Mathina’s definition” a problem may arise: if we build a mould around a solid angle of the great rhombicuboctahedron,  [the mould won’t fit all the solid angles]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg15): in this case, [two moulds are needed]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg16).

Nevertheless, if we look at both moulds, we may notice that [they are the reflected image of each other]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg17).

In this case, we will consider all the vertices of the polyhedron as being of "the same type".

With this extended definition, we can now state that all the vertices of the Great rhombicuboctahedron are of the same type: in fact, the two moulds considered -- the original and the reflected one -- [fit perfectly in all the vertices]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg18). And the same thing happens for all the four polyhedra presented above. So, taking into account Mathina’s definition, the four polyhedra seem uniform. However, in the story, the technician claims that one of them is not uniform: [**the Miller polyhedron**]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg19).

This discrepancy is related to the definition of uniform polyhedron. For the technician, the condition "all the vertices are of the same type" should be replaced by a stronger one, which highlights the symmetrical aspect of the polyhedron: "for each pair of vertices, there is at least one symmetry of the polyhedron that takes one vertex onto the other". Thus, a **uniform polyhedron** is a polyhedron:

`*` whose faces are all regular polygons, but not all with the same number of sides;

`*` for each pair of vertices, there is at least one symmetry of the polyhedron that takes one vertex onto the other.

In the story, a **polyhedron symmetry** is defined as an isometry (i.e. a function that preserves distances) that takes the polyhedron onto itself. For further information on the subject, please consult: 1) [the given examples]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg20), and 2) the “What is a symmetry?” chapter presented in the text about the story ["Stamping friezes"](https://mathina-edu.netlify.app/story/stamping-friezes).

Why is the Miller polyhedron non uniform? If we consider vertices *A* and *B*, any isometry taking *A* into *B* will remove the ring of squares from the equator, thus [changing the final aspect of the polyhedron]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg21).

[Manipulate the polyhedron here]($HUB_URL/apps/anims/poliedros.html?pre=pol_68).

However if we [rotate the octagonal dome on the top of the Miller polyhedron by 45º]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg22), we get a new uniform polyhedron: the small rhombicuboctahedron.

Throughout the story, the characters get acquainted with **all uniform polyhedra**: 1) an infinite family of prisms, [whose bases are regular polygons and whose side faces are squares]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg23); 2) an infinite family of anti-prisms, [whose bases are regular polygons and whose side faces are equilateral triangles]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg24); 3) other 13 polyhedron:

![Uniform polyhedra](/stories/symm-4/img/_align-center_/uniformes.png =675x400)

In the end, the characters build a model for the [“Platonic and uniform polyhedra” carousel]($HUB_URL/story/the-polyhedron-carousel/?actionLink=tg25). It consists of highly symmetrical polyhedra: in fact, for each polyhedron, and for each pair of vertices, there is at least one symmetry of the polyhedron which takes one vertex onto the other.

# Didactical remarks

By using storytelling and games, our main goal is to lead young learners to discover Polyhedra (and their symmetry) in a playful way.

Starting with some concrete experiments carried out by the characters, experiments which are thoroughly illustrated by the animations and images provided, we present, in an intuitive way, various mathematical concepts: convex/non convex polyhedra, Platonic Solids, Uniform Polyhedra, .... The understanding of these concepts is deepened throughout the story, and the young learners have the opportunity to consolidate their knowledge, in a playful way, by reading the story, watching the visually attractive films/images, and by solving the various games and challenges proposed in the available apps.

The story is self-contained and should not require consulting additional materials. For this purpose, two factors were taken into account: 1) almost no need of previous knowledge of the subject; 2) adequacy of the contents to the 15/19+ age group: in fact, although presently “Platonic Solids” is not a subject addressed in the Portuguese Mathematics curriculum, some years ago, it was included in the “Upper Secondary” curriculum (15/17 years).

In addition to the mathematical topic “Platonic Solids”, there is another one which is not included in the Portuguese academic curricula: “Uniform Polyhedra”. By introducing this subject, we intend to convey a broader geometric idea about polyhedra and highlight the highly symmetric features common both to Platonic Solids and Uniform Polyhedra: 1) they are formed by regular polygons, 2) for each pair of vertices, there is at least one symmetry of the polyhedron that takes one vertex onto the other.

Additional experiments similar to the ones presented in the story can be developed by educators. Below, we make a proposal for several of them:

`*` Platonic Solids: 
  * the experiment of "building the five Platonic Solids" can be physically developed with students, by using cardboard or other materials available for the purpose;
  * the construction of different nets for the cube or for other Platonic solids can also be explored with students, for instance using cardboard;
  * checking that Platonic solids have “equal dihedral angles” as well as “equal solid angles at each vertex” can be simulated with the students, using physical models of the Platonic solids and moulds built, for instance, with plasticine.


`*` Uniform Polyhedra:
  * checking that, in a uniform polyhedron, all vertices are “of the same type” can also be simulated with the students, by using physical models of the polyhedra and moulds.

# About the apps

There are 5 apps accompanying the story: 3 are dedicated to finding certain types of polyhedra (Convex, Uniform, and non Platonic polyhedra whose faces are regular and equal polygons) and the remaining 2 to polyhedra nets.

All the apps were programmed in JavaScript and should be usable both on PCs and tablets/smartphones.

Below, we present a small description of each app. Links both for the apps and for explanatory films about them (in Mathina’s YouTube channel) are also provided.
